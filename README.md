  ## Using Express and Mongoose, create an application that organizes code snippets that you save for later use.

  ## At a minimum, snippets should have:

* Code Snippet Organizer
* a body (the code)
* optional notes
* a language
* Node, Express, Mongoose, MongoDB, Handlebars...
* tags -- that is, user-defined words or phrases that classify the code, like "authentication", "front-end", "middleware", or "database".

  ### Your application must:

* have a comprehensive set of tests for all controllers and models
* have registration and login
* allow you to create a snippet
* allow you to see a list of all your snippets
* allow you to see a list of all your snippets for a specific language
* allow you to see a list of all your snippets for a specific tag
* allow you to look at an individual snippet
* have an API to allow for creating and viewing of snippets as listed above
